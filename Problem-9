Problem statement:
Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and checks whether it is a prime number.

Logic:
If the number is less than or equal to 1 → not prime
Check divisibility from 2 to n-1
If divisible by any number → not prime

Solution:
num = int(input())
is_prime = True
if num <= 1:
    is_prime = False
else:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break
if is_prime:
    print("Prime")
else:
    print("Not Prime")
