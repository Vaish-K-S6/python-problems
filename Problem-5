Given a number n, print numbers from 1 to n.
But:
print "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3
print "Buzz" if divisible by 5
print "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both 3 and 5
otherwise, print the number

Logic:
Use a for loop
Use if–elif–else
Check 3 and 5 together first, then separately

Solution:
n = int(input())
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("buzz")
    else:
        print(i)
