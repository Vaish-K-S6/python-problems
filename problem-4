Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and prints the reverse of that number.

Logic:
Take last digit using % 10
Add it to a new number
Remove last digit using // 10
Repeat until number becomes 0


Solution:

num = int(input())
reverse = 0
while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10
    reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
    num = num // 10
print(reverse)
