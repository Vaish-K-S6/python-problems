Find the Sum of Digits of a Number
Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and prints the sum of its digits.
Take a number as input

Logic:
Repeat until the number becomes 0:
Get last digit using % 10
Add it to sum
Remove last digit using // 10
Print the final sum

Solution:
num = int(input())
total = 0
while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10
    total += digit
    num = num // 10
print(total)
