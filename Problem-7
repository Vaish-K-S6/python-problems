Write a Python program that takes an integer as input and checks whether it is a palindrome.

* A number is called a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

Logic 
Store the original number
Reverse the number
Compare the reversed number with the original

Solution:

num = int(input())
temp = num
reverse = 0
while num > 0:
    digit = num % 10
    reverse = reverse * 10 + digit
    num = num // 10
if reverse == temp:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not Palindrome")
