Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and prints the largest among them.

Logic:
Compare the first number with the second and third
If it is greater than both, it is the largest
Otherwise check the second
Else the third is the largest

Solution:

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
if a >= b and a >= c:
    print(a)
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(c)
