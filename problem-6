Write a Python program that takes a positive integer as input and prints the number of digits in it.

Hint:
Start a counter at 0
Repeat while the number is greater than 0
Divide the number by 10
Increase the counter
The counter will be the number of digits

Solution:
num = int(input())
count = 0
while num > 0:
    num = num // 10
    count += 1
print(count)
